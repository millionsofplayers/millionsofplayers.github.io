ABOUT ME AND THIS WEBSITE!
      </marquee></center></h1>
      My name is millions, and I'm a Geometry Dash youtuber.<br>
      
      I don't upload that often, as seen by the fact that I've uploaded 5 times this year and it's already 25% done.<br>
      
      My pronouns are he/him, and my favorite color <sup>(right now)</sup> is purple.<br>

      If you want to see what I'm up to, go to the socials tab up on the top.<br>

      <h2>ABOUT THE SERVER:</h2><br>

      <ul>
	      <li>This server is currently being ran on a laptop in my house along with cloudflare to hide my IP.</li>
	      <li>If the server goes down, I either messed something up or it's being DDoS'd. Or I'm just restarting the laptop.</li>
	      <li>The server also uses nginx which is being ran through a docker container.</li>
	      <li>The code for all the pages on this website is hosted <a href="https://github.com/millionsofplayers/millionsofplayers.github.io">here</a>. This may not be updated as often as the actual website.</li>
	      <li>If you find an issue with the server, email me at <a href="mailto:millions@ofplayers.net">millions@ofplayers.net</a>.</li>
