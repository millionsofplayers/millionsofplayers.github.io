      <p>Happy new year! The first part of this blogpost was written 2 weeks ago, I just procrastinated for a while. With that out of the way, hereâ€™s my first blog post of 2024!<br>

So a few days ago I found out about something called <a href="https://geminiprotocol.net/">Gemini.</a> I still don't really know how it works, but it's some kind of alternative to the internet.<br>

Anyways, I was looking for linux terminal browsers for it, and i found this program called <a href="https://github.com/blmayer/astro">Astro.</a> The application is either supposed to be launched from the terminal in a folder or moved to your PATH. I tried this on an old laptop i had lying around with Linux Mint on it, and it worked pretty well. I could browse pages fast and it looks nice as well.
